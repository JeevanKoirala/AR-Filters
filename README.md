# AR-Filters
I will soon add more filters to this but for now i have not got that much time and it already took a lot so for now enjoy..
this has been made through the use of opencv mediapipe numpy
you guys can trigger those filteres using 1 2 3 key 
for the face landmarks i have used AI for help and a bit of internet scraping etc
its just a simple poject so hope you guys will understand everything through the demo so i am not writing much here it just applies filters to your face and soon i will make more filtere uploads
